My main preference when buying a new laptop would be the pc configuration concerning the processor.I would personally love to buy a gaming pc with advanced processors and a dedicated graphic card.I would also look at the battery specification and the no of threads in the microprocessor and the processor speed.Apart from these, the weight and the ease of carrying is also a point of consideration before buying any laptop.
Anything else like new features some innovative sensors is an additional perk but not a priority.I use my laptop to code,read and play games.So a good and powerful CPU is going to meet my requirements.
